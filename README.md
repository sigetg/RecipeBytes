# ðŸ¥ª Welcome to [RecipeBytes](https://lindazhang23.github.io/RecipeBytes/)!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Meet Linda and George, the Recipe Bytes team

- Two wannabe SWEs just messing around
- Linda is neurodiverse, and hates the hassle and unnecessary stress assocated with cooking
- George has been cooking his whole life ands the cooking club at BC, and wanted a way to organize his recipes.

# Why We Built This

We wanted to create a web app that makes cooking more approachable â€” whether you're a total beginner or an experienced home chef. More importantly, we want to make cooking inclusive for people with health-related dietary restrictions, whether due to allergies, chronic conditions, or personal lifestyle choices.

## This app helps users:

- Search for recipes that exclude restricted ingredients (based on their profile)
- Save and organize personal favorites
- Build grocery lists and meal prep plans tailored to individual dietary needs
- Eventually, leverage AI-search to help to discover new dishes that meet their unique health requirements

# Our Goals

- Migrate to MongoDB for better scalability
- Allow users to add custom recipes, make the workflow much easier and personable
- Might switch to a better API service, or if we really have the time, write our own
- Integrate an AI internet search feature for recipes

## This Is a Learning Journey

This project isn't just about building an app â€” it's about learning and growing as developers.
There will be bugs. We'll change our minds. We'll hit walls.
But we'll also hit those moments where everything clicks â€” and that rush is why we do this.

Whether you're here to contribute, give feedback, or just check out what we're building â€” welcome ðŸ«¶
